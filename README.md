## General Information
- The project is to develop a model that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

## Background
- This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

## Busines problem
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Dataset
A csv file of loan which contains the previous loan applications of the company

## Conclusions
Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
-loan status
-Grades
-Verification Status
-Annual income
-Pub_rec_bankruptcies
Other considerations for 'defaults' :
-Burrowers having annual income in the range 50000-100000.
-Burrowers having Public Recorded Bankruptcy.
-Burrowers with least grades like E,F,G which indicates high risk.
-Burrowers with very high Debt to Income value.
-Burrowers with working experience 10+ years.
